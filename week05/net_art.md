##### ðŸ’¾   Pair programming presentation net.art project
With a partner, students will choose 1 artwork or artist from either the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) or [Chronus Art Center's last three exhibitions](http://www.chronusartcenter.org/en/exhibition/) to present to the class in a 5-7  minute presentation. Students should share a brief introduction to the artists, an explainatino fo the work and their thoughts on the expirence of the artwork. 
* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + host on your class site. Each slide can be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * it's own directory + file path linked from your class site home page
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex or Grid Display on some portion of the page(s)
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * At least three pictures and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. An "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Post a link to your net.art Presentation Web Site (Slide Deck) 
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from both people in the partnership. And if you want to somehow make yr presention interactive // inspired by the work you reserached - that's even better!

#### Assignment for Tuesday
Research which artwork you would like to present. Meet with your partner and once you decide post a link to the work by your names [here](https://github.com/IDMNYU/webDev_D_Spring2022/wiki/Week-05). ** You can not do an artwork that has been posted by another pair!!** 

Spend time with the work together and talk about the expirence of looking at it. Make notes - this conversation will lead to your talking points in the presentation. Take screen shots and/or recordings of yourself interacting with the work. If you each have a different experience of the piece - great! Show us and talk about the differences. Not simply "i liked it, s/he didn't" but actually what you each materially experienced on your different screens. 

#### Presentations due during class
