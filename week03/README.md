        <p id="mashed"> John Berger is a very expressive, if not also detailed narrator. When watching the interesting, yet tedious four - part documentary, Berger really delves deep into how we see the world. Also, he greatly explains deeply our perceptions on how we as a people look at all sorts of objects, such as paintings.
            Berger shows us all different types of paintings that were depicted throughout Ancient Greece all the way to the European Renaissance period. Here, I would like to zero in on women of all different types of sizes. As someone who is minoring in Women and Gender Studies, or now also know as Gender and Sexuality Studies, there were women who were not only size 0 through 2. Yet, we also viewed portraits of women who were curvy with an hour - glass figure, or who were rather plump.
            Now, let us fast - forward to the modern - age of the early 1970's, 1972 to be rather more accurate. The majority of the women depicted in the modeling shoot, were extremely thin, mostly blond, and very anorexic - looking. In some way of sorts, Berger is trying to convey a message of sorts how society has evolved overtime. What was acceptable for a woman to look like, has now become of a figment of the past, if you will.
            In some way or another, we are sending out a message to women that they must be a size 0 through 2. A size 12 is not something that she should be proud of. That is sending out a very poor message, by showing women this is the proper body to have. Having a full - figure is not something to aspire  to. The issue of " sex sells," was very true back then in 1972, just as it is in the year 2022.</p>
