		<p class="theSpecial"> There is then as I am saying complete disillusion in living, the realis- ing, completely realising that not any one, not one fighting for the same thinking and believing as the other, not any one has the same believing in her or in him that any other
			one has in them and it comes then some- time to most every one to be realising with feeling this thing and then they often stop having friendly feeling and then often they begin again but it is then a different thing between them, they are old then
			and not young then in their feeling.

		Young ones sometimes think they have it in them, this thing, some young ones kill themselves then, stop living then, this is often happen- ing, young ones sometimes, very often even, think they have in them this thing but they do not have it in them,
		mostly not any young one, as a complete realisation, this thing, they have it in them and it is sometimes, very often then an agony to them, some of them kill themselves or are killed then, but really mostly not any of them have really realised the
		thing, they may be dead from this thing, they have not realised the thing, it has been an awful agony in them, they have not really grasped the thing as having general human meaning, it has been a shock to them, it may perhaps even have killed completely
		very completely some of them, mostly then a young one has not really such a thing in them, this is pretty nearly certain, later there will be much description of disillusion- ment in the being of David Hersland who was always in his living as I was
		saying trying to be certain from clay to day in his living what there was in living that could make it for him a completely necessary thing.
	</p>
	<p>This is then a very little description of feeling disillusionment in living. There is this thing then there is the moment and a very complete moment to those that have had it when something they have bought or made or loved or are is a thing that they
		are afraid, almost certain, very fearful that no one will think it a nice thing and then some one likes that thing and this then is a very wonderful feeling to know that some one really appreciates the thing. This is a very wonderful thing, this is
		a thing which I will now be illustrating.

		Disillusionment in living is the finding out nobody agrees with you not those that are and were fighting with you. Disillusionment in living is the finding out nobody agrees with you not those that are fighting for you. Complete disillusionment is when
		you realise that no one can for they can't change. The amount they agree is important to you until the amount they do not agree with you is completely realised by you. Then you say you will write for yourself and strangers, you will be for yourself
		and strangers and this then makes an old man or an old woman of you. </p>
